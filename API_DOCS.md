## Authentication

### Basic Authentication

All protected endpoints use **HTTP Basic Authentication** with the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic <base64(email:password)>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Credentials: user@example.com:mypassword
# Base64 encoded: dXNlckBleGFtcGxlLmNvbTpteXBhc3N3b3Jk

curl -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlckBleGFtcGxlLmNvbTpteXBhc3N3b3Jk" \
  http://localhost:3000/doctors
```

### User Roles

The system supports 4 role types:
- **`user`** — Patient/end-user (non-medical)
- **`doctor`** — Healthcare provider
- **`trainer`** — Fitness/wellness trainer
- **`admin`** — Front desk/system administrator

---

## Service Routes

### Base Path: `/services`

**Global Requirements:**
- ✅ Basic Authentication required
- ✅ Admin creates/updates/deletes; all roles can read

**Implementation Notes:**
- Therapies are persisted in the same underlying collection as services with `serviceType = "Therapy"`.

  "tags": ["assessment", "baseline"],
  "slots": ["507f1f77bcf86cd799439020"]

```

  "slots": ["507f1f77bcf86cd799439020"]
}
```

**Credit Notes:**
- `creditCost` is optional and defaults to `1` when omitted.
- Booking and appointment deduction uses this value when the therapy `_id` is used as `serviceId`.

#### 2. Get All Therapies

```
GET /therapies/:id

## Lead Routes

### Base Path: `/leads`

**Global Requirements:**
- ✅ `POST /leads/public-capture` is public (no auth)
- ✅ All other lead endpoints require Basic Authentication
- ✅ Admin can list/delete/convert; Admin/Doctor/Trainer can create/read/update
- **Lead Status Values:** `New`, `Contacted`, `Qualified`, `Warm`, `Hot`, `Cold`, `Converted`, `Lost`

#### 1. Public Lead Capture
```
POST /leads/public-capture
```

**Authentication:** ❌ None  
**Authorization:** N/A

**Request Body A (fitflix.in health score form):**
```json
{
  "formType": "healthscore",
  "personalDetails": {
    "fullName": "Arjun Sharma",
    "phoneNumber": "+91 98765 43210",
    "emailAddress": "arjun@email.com",
    "age": 32,
    "gender": "Male",
    "city": "Hyderabad",
    "primaryHealthGoal": "Longevity & Disease Prevention",
    "fitnessLevel": "Intermediate (6mo - 2yrs)",
    "wellnessInterests": ["Yoga & Mindfulness", "Sleep Optimisation"],
    "notes": "Mild lower-back stiffness"
  },
  "assessment": {
    "version": "v1_quick_vitality_check",
    "answers": {
      "v1_q1": 3,
      "v1_q2": 3,
      "v1_q3": 2,
      "v1_q4": 3,
      "v1_q5": 2,
      "v1_q6": 3,
      "v1_q7": 2
    }
  },
  "source": "fitflix.in",
  "tags": ["website", "campaign-april"],
  "followUpDate": "2026-04-15T00:00:00Z",
  "captchaToken": "<token-from-client-captcha>",
  "website": ""
}
```

**Request Body B (plain callback form):**
```json
{
  "formType": "callback",
  "name": "Arjun Sharma",
  "phone": "+91 98765 43210",
  "email": "arjun@email.com",
  "interests": ["Nutrition & Diet", "Sleep Optimisation"],
  "source": "fitflix.in",
  "tags": ["website", "call-me"],
  "captchaToken": "<token-from-client-captcha>",
  "website": ""
}
```

**Compatibility Notes:**
- Plain callback supports `name`, `phone`, `email`, and `interests` array.
- `intrests` is also accepted as a compatibility alias for `interests`.
- Legacy shape with top-level `leadName` + `email` is still accepted.
- `assessment.version` supports `v1_quick_vitality_check` and `v2_deep_longevity_assessment`.
- `assessment.answers` must include all required question IDs for the selected version, with score values from `1` to `4`.

**Security Behavior:**
- IP-based rate limit is applied.
- Captcha verification is temporarily disabled for MVP testing.
- `website` is a honeypot field. If non-empty, the API returns `202` but ignores the payload.
- Health score and brand tier are computed automatically when `assessment` is provided.

**Response (202 Accepted):**
```json
{
  "message": "Lead captured",
  "leadId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",

## Booking Routes

### Base Path: `/bookings`

**Global Requirements:**
- ✅ Basic Authentication required for all endpoints

#### 1. Create Booking
```
POST /bookings
```

**Authorization:** User (own), Admin (any user)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "bookingDate": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z",
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "slotId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439020",
  "serviceId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439030",
  "reportId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439040",
  "bypassCredits": false
}
```

**Notes:**
- `userId` — Required for admin. Optional for users (uses their ID).
- `reportId` — Optional field.
- `bypassCredits` — Optional; only admins can set `true`.
- `serviceId` can be either a regular service ID (from `/services`) or a therapy ID (from `/therapies`) because both are stored under the same bookable service identity.
- `slotId` can be a one-off slot instance or a daily slot template ID.
- When `slotId` references a daily template, backend resolves/creates a dated slot inventory record for `bookingDate` and books against that concrete record.
- Credit consumption amount is read from `service.creditCost`.
- Booking creation atomically decrements slot `remainingCapacity` by `1`.
- If slot `remainingCapacity` is `0`, booking creation must fail.

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "message": "Booking created",
  "booking": {
    "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439050",
    "bookingDate": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z",

    "slot": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439020",
    "service": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439030",
    "report": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439040",
    "createdAt": "2026-03-20T10:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-20T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "credits": {
    "consumed": 2,
    "bypassed": false
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `402` — Insufficient credits.
- `403` — No active membership with available credits, or non-admin bypass attempt.

```

**Authorization:** Admin only

---

#### 5. Update Booking

}
```

---

#### 6. Delete Booking
```
DELETE /bookings/:id
```

- If the booking is not already cancelled, delete first applies cancellation compensation: refund consumed credits once and release one slot capacity for the dated inventory slot.
- If the booking is already cancelled, delete does not apply additional compensation.

---

#### 7. Change Booking Status
```
PATCH /bookings/:id/status
```

**Authorization:** Admin only

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "status": 1
}
```

**Behavior:**
- When status transitions to `Cancelled`, credits previously consumed for that booking are refunded once.
- When status transitions to `Cancelled`, one slot capacity is released back to the same dated slot inventory record.
- Cancellation compensation is idempotent for repeated cancel requests. Subsequent cancel requests return `refunded: 0`.

**Response (200 OK) Example:**
```json
{
  "message": "Booking status changed",
  "booking": {
    "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439050",

}
```

**Notes:**

- `serviceId` may point to a regular service (`/services`) or therapy (`/therapies`) ID.

## Notes for Development

- All timestamps are in **ISO 8601** format (UTC)
- All IDs are MongoDB **ObjectId** strings
- Passwords are stored as **bcrypt hashes** and never returned in API responses
- Date fields accept various formats that coerce to Date objects
- Array fields (like `specialities`, `todoIds`) default to empty arrays if not provided
- At least one field is required for PATCH operations
- Role-based access is enforced per endpoint

## Support & Questions

For questions or issues with the API:
1. Check this documentation
2. Review the endpoint authorization requirements
3. Verify Basic Auth headers are properly formatted
4. Check that resource IDs are valid MongoDB ObjectIds
